                <li>-2,906 : Mankind encounters their first M class garden planet, naming it Eden. Eden is inhabited by a race of giant invertebrates which was declared to be non-sentient and soon eradicated.</li>
                <li>-2,790 : Mankind is challenged by the Corax, a species who had long traded with the Edonites and viewed them with religious awe for the pristine state of their world.</li>
                <li>-2,688 : The reagency of Western galactic territories enfolds humanity into the community with the hopes of resolving their war with the Corax</li>
                <li>-2,159 : The Corax are defeated and annexed to their home system, in which they soon starve and become extinct.</li> 
                <li>-1,800 : Humanity expands their terrotories exponentially. Through trade negotiations and war they become the dominant power in the galaxy.</li>
                <li>-1,595 : Strange larval organisms are discovered on several outlying human colony worlds. They possess a strange form of highly-mutable DNA which can metabolize highly dangerous forms of radiation.

                <li>-1,383 : Xen-Seti laced colonial worlds one-by-one begin going dark. All human life on these worlds vanishes.</li>
                <li>-1,209 : The Xen-Seti begin appearing on worlds in which they were previously not present. War is declared on the threat. The reagency offers no aid.</li>
                <li>-1,030 : Human dominance over the galaxy is broken. Humans begin retracting deeper and deeper into their own territory, but always the Xen-Seti appear.</li>
                <li>-670 : The human home system is invaded. All trace of human life dissapears.</li>
